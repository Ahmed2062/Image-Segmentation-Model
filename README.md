# Image-Segmentation-Model
This project implements an end-to-end deep learning‚Äìbased image segmentation system using the Mask-RCNN architecture and OpenCV‚Äôs DNN module. The goal was to accurately detect and visually segment multiple object instances within an image. Pre-trained Mask-RCNN weights were loaded using OpenCV and NumPy, and the pipeline included image preprocessing, blob conversion, model inference, and post-processing to generate object masks and bounding boxes. Techniques like contour detection, color masking, and image blending were applied to highlight segmented areas. The system demonstrates real-time performance and provided hands-on experience with computer vision, deep learning, and the OpenCV DNN pipeline.
